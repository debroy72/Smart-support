SmartSupport – AI-powered log file analysis for customer support

🔍  Problem: Manually analyzing log files is time-consuming and prone to errors. Recurring error patterns offer great potential for automation. Fast and in-depth initial analyses increase customer satisfaction and reduce the workload on the support team.

🎯  HACKATHON CHALLENGE: Develop a tool that automatically scans log files for known error patterns, identifies root causes, and provides initial suggestions for solutions. This will accelerate support processes and sustainably improve service quality.

📊  Available data & resources: Use of anonymized or synthetic sample log files. Use of AI tools for text classification (e.g., open-source NLP models, regular expressions, classic ML approaches). Development of a prototype with a GUI that provides an initial assessment (e.g., "error detected during license check"). Preparation of a short final presentation.

🏆 Success criteria :  You will actively shape the future of digital customer support. Your solution will help accelerate support processes and improve service quality. You will lay the foundation for a continuously learning system that will sustainably relieve the burden on our support team.

💡  Requirements: Development of a working prototype that reads and analyzes log files. Automatic detection of error patterns and provision of recommended actions for support staff. Simple user interface for loading log files. Bonus: Highlighting key points in the log file for even faster analysis.
